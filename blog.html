                  Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a
                  primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been
                  assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other
                  hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has
                  not been assigned.

                  An API, or application programming interface, is a set of
                  rules that define how applications or devices can connect to
                  and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that
                  conforms to the design principles of the REST, or
                  representational state transfer architectural style. For this
                  reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
